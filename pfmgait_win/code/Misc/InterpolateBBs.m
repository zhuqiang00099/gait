function I = InterpolateBBs(BB1, BB2)

% Interpolate between bounding-boxes BB1 and BB2,
% by adding an extra BB for every frame in BB1(1):BB2(1)
%
% BBs are considered rigid in aspect-ratio,
% so the (x,y) location of the center is interpolated linearly,
% and the scale is interpolated 'productrialy'.
%
% Input:
% BB = [frame_id min_x min_y width height scale score flip class pointer]'
%       with pointer being the pointer to the original D matrix entry for that class
% Only supports interpolation between two BBs of the same class.
%
% Output:
% I(:,ix) = interpolated bounding-boxes
%           (not including BB1 and BB2)
%

% scale (I(6,:)) of new dets is also a prod-interp of BB1(6) to BB2(6);
% score of new dets is the mean of scores of BB1 and BB2
% flip flag copied half from BB1 and half from BB1 (at this point everything should have been flipped already anyway)
% pointer (I(:,10)) set to -1, to mark these BBs do not come form the original D matrix for the class (i.e. have not been detected)
